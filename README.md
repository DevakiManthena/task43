# SolarSmart – README

## Overview

SolarSmart is a web‑based application designed to help users estimate potential solar energy production, cost savings, and environmental benefits from installing solar panels. Users input their household energy consumption, solar panel capacity, and location, and the system generates real‑time calculations along with visual charts for better understanding.

This README explains the project structure, features, setup instructions, calculation methodology, and challenges.

## Features / Functional Requirements

### 1. Input & Calculations

* Input monthly household energy consumption
* Select location (sunlight hours vary)
* Enter solar panel capacity (kW)
* Automatic estimation of:

  * Daily & monthly solar energy production
  * Cost savings based on electricity cost
  * CO₂ emissions reduced

### 2. Visualization

* Bar chart comparing energy consumption vs solar production using **Chart.js**
* Clean and responsive UI with HTML & CSS

---

## Optional Enhancements Included

* Comparison visualization (consumption vs production)
* Seasonal/location‑based changes (via sunlight hours options)
* Optimization suggestions (implicit through calculation parameters)
* Educational content possible to add in separate sections

## Project Structure

```
/solarsmart
 │
 ├── task43.html      # Main website file
 ├── styles.css      # Inline CSS inside HTML (can be separated)
 └── script.js       # JS is written inside HTML for simplicity
```

---

## How to Run the Project

1. Download or copy the code from the main HTML file.
2. Save it as: `task43.html`.
3. Double‑click the file OR open it through a browser.
4. No server required — runs fully in the browser.

## Calculation Methodology

### **1. Solar Energy Production Formula**

```
Daily Production (kWh) = Panel Capacity (kW) × Sunlight Hours
Monthly Production = Daily Production × 30
```

### **2. Cost Savings Formula**

```
Savings (₹/month) = Monthly Production × Cost per kWh (₹8 assumed)
```

### **3. CO₂ Emission Reduction Formula**

```
Carbon Saved (kg/month) = Monthly Production × 0.7
```

## Libraries Used

* **Chart.js CDN** for charts
* No backend or external frameworks required

---

## Deliverables Covered

*  Source code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
*  README file with setup & methodology
*  Visualization screenshots possible by running the project
*  GitHub upload‑ready
*  Suitable for project report integration

---

## Challenges

1. Ensuring accurate and understandable solar calculations.
2. Designing intuitive and user‑friendly visualizations.
3. Balancing technical accuracy with simplicity for non‑technical users.
4. Handling variation in sunlight hours across regions.
5. Displaying meaningful insights with minimal user input.

## Future Enhancements

* Add solar panel model comparison
* Seasonal efficiency charts
* AI-powered solar usage optimization suggestions
* Carbon footprint history tracking
* Backend support for saving user data
